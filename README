Net-RDEP version 0.01
=====================

This module really consists of two packages, Net::RDEP and XML::Idiom.  The
Net::RDEP module handles the protocol exchange between the RDEP client and
server and the XML::Idiom module processes the document retrieved from the 
server.

The XML::Idiom implementation is pretty basic, so you may want to enhance or
expand it with your own version, depending on what you're trying to do.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

The Net::RDEP module requires: MIME::Base64 and LWP::UserAgent.  You'll also want
Crypt-SSLeay if you want to use SSL in your communication between client/server.

XML::Idiom requires only XML::Simple.
